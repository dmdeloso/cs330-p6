        <p class="projectpage-text">I'm a second-year studying journalism and human-centered design at Northwestern University. I have a passion for multimedia storytelling, with experience in photography, audio, video, graphic design and web design. <br>
I'm the editor-in-chief of North by Northwestern, the largest independent student publication on campus. There, I've covered rap concerts, comedy shows and much more.<br>
Since Spring 2019, I've been producing interactive storytelling pieces for North by Northwestern Interactive. I designed the presentation for a feature piece about dealing with loss, and created an interactive guide to Dillo Day, the largest student-run music festival in the country. <br>
I also co-host and produce a podcast called Second GenerAsian with two of my closest friends. On it, we dissect any and all issues pertaining to the Asian Diaspora in a (hopefully) entertaining manner. <br>
In my free time, I love to listen to hip-hop, watch stand-up specials and drink sparkling water. <br>
Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to shoot me an email if you wanna get in touch.</p>
