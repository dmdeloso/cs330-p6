        <p class="projectpage-text">Dillo Day, held annualy at Northwestern, is the largest student-run music festival in the country, featuring a lineup of famous artists on the main stage.
As entertainment editor for North by Northwestern, created an interactive guide to the festival, breaking down the info about each artist into digestible sections. The webpage is responsive, and converts to a single-column layout on mobile devices. All web development was done by me, and artist write-ups were contributed by various entertainment writers</p>
